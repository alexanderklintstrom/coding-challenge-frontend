Stolen bikes is a typical problem in Malmö, where the Docly HQ is. We need your help to build an app that will help us keep track of the bikes stolen in the area!

# Requirements

- [ ] I want to pull data from the [Bikewise API](https://www.bikewise.org/documentation/api_v2#!/incidents/GET_version_incidents_format_get_0)
- [ ] I want to see a list of bikes stolen in the Malmö area (the coordinates for our office are `55.607405,12.998945`)
- [ ] For each reported theft I want to see
  - [ ] Case title
  - [ ] Case description
  - [ ] Date of the theft (format `yyyy-mm-dd hh:ss`)
  - [ ] Date of the report (format `yyyy-mm-dd hh:ss`)
  - [ ] Location of the theft
  - [ ] Image of the bike (if available)
  - [ ] Link to a page with more information
- [ ] I want to see a loading state while the cases are loading
- [ ] I want to be able to filter the cases by title and by location
- [ ] I want to be able to use the app on mobile as well as desktop, with mobile being the most important.

# Tech requirements

- React
- Tests (we like [Jest](https://jestjs.io))
- Linter (we like [https://prettier.io](prettier))
- CSSinJS is a plus, but not a requirement ([JSS](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss/), [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com))

# Your challenge

- Create a React app that satisfies all the requirements listed above. If you have ideas for nice-to-have features you are welcome to add them.
- You can use any boilerplate and tools that you want to (NextJS, CRA etc) but we advice you to keep it simple. A clean, robust react app is what we're looking for, and we're usually in favor of using all available tools and tricks to get things done.
- You don't have to support legacy browsers, and you're free to use any and all modern browser features that you wish (flexbox, fetch etc).
- You can deploy your app on whatever cloud provider you wish (zeit, heroku, gcp etc)

# Instructions
